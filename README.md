# m2sdk

This is a repo, containing up-to-date results of game research information provided in form of C++ header-only library.
By publishing this repo, we are hoping to find and attract more people that are interested in the Mafia 2 researching/modding/reversing,
and possibly even contributing to make this thing even better.

Prjects using this library:

* Mafia 2 Online

## Installtion

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:mafia2online/m2sdk.git
```

```c
#include <m2sdk/m2sdk.h>
```

## Structure

Code devided into 3 different categories, by folders:

* classes - partially reversed game classes
* wrappers - lightweight wrappers around game classes to make things simplier to work w/
* utils - that is obvious

## Contributing

All contributions are highly welcomed! Feel free to suggest fixes, features, improvements.
And, of course, pull requests, we love 'em! ;)
